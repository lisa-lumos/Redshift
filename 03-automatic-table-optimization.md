# 3. Automatic table optimization
Automatic table optimization is a self-tuning capability, that automatically optimizes the design of  tables by applying sort and distribution keys without the need for administrator intervention. 

By using automation to tune the design of tables, you can get started and get the fastest performance  without investing time to manually tune and implement table optimizations. 

Existing tables with a  distribution style or sort key of AUTO are already enabled for automation. 

## Enabling, disabling, and monitoring automatic table optimization
By default, tables created without explicitly defining sort keys or distributions keys are set to AUTO. 

## Column compression

## Data distribution

## Sort keys
## Table constraints
