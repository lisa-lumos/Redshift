# 2. Best Practices
## Conduct a proof of concept (POC) for Amazon Redshift
In general, we recommend using two weeks of data for an Amazon Redshift POC.

The first time you use Redshift Serverless, the console leads you through the steps required to launch your warehouse. You might also be eligible for a credit towards your Redshift Serverless usage in your account.

For quick ingestion and analysis, you can use Amazon Redshift query editor v2 to easily load data files from your local desktop.

Autocopy (in preview) is an extension of the COPY command and automates continuous data loading from Amazon S3 buckets.
